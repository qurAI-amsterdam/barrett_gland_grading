## BE expert-level gland grading with Neural Networks
This repository contains code for development of a Neural Network that support pathologists with identifying dysplastic 
areas of interest on H&E tissue samples from patients with Barrett's Esophagus (BE). 

### The Task:
BE is associated with an increased risk of developing esophageal cancer. Regular check-ups and pathological assessment of biopsy material are crucial for identifying BE patients at risk.
Dysplasia in BE is assessed according to the revised Vienna criteria, which are based on the dysplasia classification in inflammatory bowel disease. Evaluation of cytological and architectural severity and invasion status leads to assignment in
one of the following categories: negative for dysplasia, indefinite for dysplasia (IND), low grade dysplasia (LGD), noninvasive high grade dysplasia (HGD), and invasive neoplasia. Key characteristics used to assess the
dysplasia grade in BE are surface maturation, glandular architecture, and cytonuclear changes. [[1]](#1)

### Outline of the project:

- [ ] Create a clean archive dataset:
    * Individual directories for each dataset: ASL, Bolero, LANS, RBE.
        * Containing all the tiff files and xmls files (converted in the same fashion).
        * A csv file with case or biopsy level diagnosis.
    * Remove polygon annotations with <3 coordinates.
    * Gland annotations that include non tissue => mask out non tissue (Otsu)
    * Move data to the research network.
- [ ] Split data for training, evaluation and testing (keep Bolero apart for testing).
- [ ] Train a standard UNet as baseline segmentation pipeline for grading into: NDBE, LGD, HGD.
- [ ] Data augmentations for segmentation in pathology:
    * Manual
      - HookNet: spatial, color, noise and stain augmentation [[1]](#1). 
      - RaeNet: gamma transform, random flipping, Gaussian blur, affine translation and colour distortion.
    * Trivial Augment: https://pytorch.org/vision/main/generated/torchvision.transforms.TrivialAugmentWide.html.
    * HE Auto augment: https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/pathology-he-auto-augment.
    * Spatial augmentations need to be applied on both image and segmentation.
    * Stain-Transforming Cycle-Consistent GAN [[4]](#4).
- [ ] Experiments:
  * Context aggregation networks for segmentation in pathology: Hooknet [[2]](#2), RAENet [[3]](#3)
  * ImageNet pretrained encoder.
  * Roto-Translation Equivariant CNN's [[6]](#6)

### Segmentation pipeline for gland grading into: NDBE, LGD or HGD
* Networks architectures to consider: UNet, Hooknet [[2]](#2), RAENet [[3]](#3)
* For on fly patch extraction we use: https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/pathology-whole-slide-data
  * Includes configuration for patch extraction such as batch size, patch size, spacing.
  * Includes different strategies to sample patches from the WSI (balanced, random, slidingwindow).
  * Configuration stored in (`configs/unet_training_config.yml`)

### Datasets 
Below a summary is shown of all the data available for this project. Gland level annotations were provided by Sybren Meijer. 
Case or slide level annotations were not provided yet. The relevant datasets on AMC servers (/data/archief/AMC-data/Barrett/) are listed below:

| Dataset   | Cases | Biopsies | Diagnosis Available<br/> biopsy/case level | Raters <br/> (biopsy/case level) |

| **Total** |  312  |   909    |                    N/A                     |               N/A                |
